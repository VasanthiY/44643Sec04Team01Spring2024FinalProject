### App Description:
Our "Smart Bill" is a bill generator application intends to provide convenience to users by detecting the items a user wants to purchase and generate an order Receipt. We are planning to use Machine Learning algorithms to train the model for detecting the items scanned.
Key Features: Item recognition, Receipt Storage, Product Beautification, Authentication, Interactive UI.

*Jameer Babu Pinjari - Backend (DB/ API Integration)*<br>
*Sai Ramya Gajula - Backend (DB/ API Integration)*<br>

Design and development of backend systems including database configurations, implementing security layer, machine learning algorithms for training model and exposing them to front end.

#### Sprint 01
Discussed among the team and suggested Spend Tracker Application for our project. Created Git repo, Abstract, WBS and wiki pages.

#### Sprint 02
As Spend Tracker is not approved suggested Weather app and Smart Bill applications. Created abstracts for both. Smart Bill is approved and updated Git repo, Wiki, WBS for the same and also documented [prototype](https://github.com/VasanthiY/44643Sec04Team01Spring2024FinalProject/blob/main/44643Sec04Team01_Prototype.docx). 

#### Sprint 03
Created an application in Xcode for our project and divided screens among ourselves . Also created individual branches to start working on the assigned screens. We have created initial design for all screens expect #6. Added navigations for first 2 screens. Refer to Sprint report table for individual contributions and also code resides in individual branches as of now and we are planning to merge to main branch in coming sprint.

#### Sprint 04
Updated our application UI screens and tried to integrate ML and firebase into it.
